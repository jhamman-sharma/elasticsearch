| Analysis Before Indexing
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before indexing the document, Elasticsearch performs a number of steps:

--> Character filtering
--> Breaking text into tokens
--> Token filtering
--> Token indexing

For example search text: "share pen & paper 2", following happens:

Step1: share Pen and Paper too
Step2: share, Pen, and, Paper, too
Step3: share, pen, paper, too
Step4: index all the tokens

NOTE: When token filtering, Elasticsearch also add possible synonyms, possibly, "ink"
for "pen", "article" for "paper".

| Analysis While Searchhing
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Search queries such as "match", "match_phrase" do perform some analysis before
searching. Queries like "term" and "terms" do not.

NOTE: In this chapter, our focus is analysis before indexing.
